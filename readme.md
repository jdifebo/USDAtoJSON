# USDA to JSON

## work in progress

The goal of this project is to convert the USDA food database (available for free [here](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/nutrient-data-laboratory/docs/sr28-download-files/).  
A lot of the fields may not make sense, so I advise that you [read the PDF](https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/SR/sr28/sr28_doc.pdf) 
to understand the underlying data.

If you only care about the finished product because you want to make something really cool with nutrition data, check out the `output/` folder!
